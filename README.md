<h1>Nessus Lab Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I'll address two pivotal steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle: vulnerability scanning and remediation. Using Nessus Essentials, this step-by-step demonstration & focus is on scanning local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation, specifically employing credentialed scans for precise vulnerability discovery. This hands-on lab offers practical experience tailored for Enterprise vulnerability management, covering tasks like remediation and verification rescans. This project serves as a valuable addition to my repertoire, showcasing very practical skills to identify vulnerabilities.
